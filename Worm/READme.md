## What Does‚Äã‚ùî‚Äã


### An exploration into remote network propogation using multiple techniques.

  -The w0rm will spread via e-mail (MAPI) all local drives and any writable network shares.
   It collects passwords on the local system to be used in
   cracking any password protected shares on the network.
 - It will write an Autorun.inf file in the root of any drives it can so when you open that drive, e.g.
 - double click it the w0rm will execute and go resident :).
 
   `This code is obviously buggy and not intended to be actually used in the 'real' world.`
   -To determine if the payload should be deployed the w0rm
  - sits on the network and plays a 'game' with other w0rms on that network
   -segment via broadcast UDP messages.
   -see relevant source for a proper idea of the 'game', its just a perverse example of too much time on ones hands :). 
   -this is `version 1.00 so the are bugs, incompatabilities with`
  - various flavors of windows and other anomolies - dose! but if you want something better write it yourself ;) (and send me a copy)
